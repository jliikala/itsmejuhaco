I've worked in various remote roles in the past 10 years, whether part-time or full, as a team leader or as a member of a team. There have been numerous challenges along the way and I can honestly say that I still run into similar challenges from time to time. However (and fortunately), I've learned to counter them with careful planning and work strategies. I’d like to share these experiences with you today.

I'm writing this post with the presumption that you're either an employer, running an international team of remote employees OR an employee, who is part of an international remote team.

All good? Let’s get started with #1.

## Challenge 1: Trust

Mutual trust, that is.

I've heard the question come up again and again.. and again.

“How can I trust that the person I hired for remote position is doing her job? What if she’s a slacker? Can I monitor her while she works?”

First, ditch the idea that you should be stalking your employee 24/7. If you really can't trust enough for her to get the job done, you might have a bigger issue in your hands. Work on that first.

It all starts with trust. In order to form a working relationship (any relationship really!), you need to have mutual trust. Without that, everything else is meaningless.

So, how do you establish that?

**How to work around this challenge:**

Start with an ice breaker. If you're an employer, ask your new remote employee to do a simple task and see how she performs. If you're an employee, deliver what was promised. Better yet, over deliver.

Let them know that you really are serious about the relationship and make a great first impression. It matters.

After that great first impression, stay consistent with your work.

If you're an employer, monitor her performance (deliverables for example), not the number of hours she puts in on an average day. Also, don't forget to thank her for the job well done when she delivers. Everyone likes to know that their work is being appreciated.

## Challenge 2: Communication & Time Zones

When you're running a team of remotees or when you're part of a team that is scattered in various locations around the world, time zone challenges are to be expected.

For example, a web development team of four people might have 2 of it’s members located in the US, third on Spain and the fourth person in Thailand. Let’s consider that one of the US team members is a leader of the remote team. He lives in California and opens up his laptop at 9am, his local time.

Now, he wants to know the current status of the project, opens up an instant messaging program they all use and shoots a message: “Hi guys! What’s the current status of the shopping cart implementation?”

* US team member 2: she lives in New York. It’s 12 o'clock and she’s currently having lunch.
* Spain team member: he lives in Madrid. It’s 6PM and he’s just in transit, on the way to his local gym.
* Thailand team member: he lives in Bangkok. It’s midnight there and he’s just about to hit the bed.

This is a rather typical situation where all the team members might still be available, but none of them are able to instantly join the conversation.
Also, there is a possibility that member #2 has stumbled on a problem that only #4 can fix. And because #4 is just getting to bed, this might postpone the whole project milestones further on the timeline.

**How to work around this challenge:**

There are a three things I would recommend here:

1. Set up a team site for your team where all the project deliverables and documentation are stored and where you can have a keep up with the conversation with your team. There are several (probably hundreds of) alternatives here. I've used Podio, SharePoint Online and Basecamp previously. As of lately, I've been experimenting with Slack, which looks very promising too.

2. Set up a team chat solution that enables instant messaging with other members of the team. You don't have to be available 24/7, but it helps immensely when other team members can shoot you with a quick question when something important comes up.

3. Set up a weekly online meeting/call with your team where you go through what each of you have been doing this week and what you're going to work on next. Also make sure that all open questions get answered, nobody is stuck and that everyone in your team knows what they are working on next.

## Challenge 3: Lack Of Focus

This is closely related to what we just talked about “being in stuck”.

If any of your team members don’t know what they are going to work on next, this results in immediate lack of focus.

If he needs to guess what should be done next on the project, he might waste his time working on something non-essential while some other bigger issue can remain untouched. Not good.

Another reason for lack of focus results from bad remote working habits:

* Choosing the wrong working spot (too busy environments where you can’t focus what you're working on)
* Working in too short or two long “sprints”. I usually work for 45 minutes and then take a short break. Then do the same again. Try the Pomodoro Technique. It’s one of my favorite ways to segment my work days.
* Choosing a spot with bad wi-fi. Especially true if you're doing any web work (obviously). If everything else fails, use your smartphone as a wireless hotspot to be able to get things rolling again.
* Extra: Working with a full bladder. Yeah, I don't think I need to explain this further. Don’t.

## Challenge 4: Being Alone

Yup, it’s true. Working remote can sometimes make you feel isolated, not being part of the “normal people with regular jobs” and even — feeling like a slacker (you know, how come you get to stay home while others leave and go to the office to work on “real jobs”?).

The thing is, it doesn't have to be this way.

First of, there’s no need to get a cabin fever and “wall yourself” into your apartment and pout. Whenever I feel that I've spent too much time working from my home office, here’s what I do:

*I grab my laptop, jump into car and drive downtown to spend some quality working time on any of my favorite cafes with wi-fi connectivity.*

Another viable option is to go to some open office space (if your town has one) and work from there. Often times, you can even rent a room from there, if you feel that you can't focus on work while staying home). These places usually have a lot of startup guys and gals working, which for me is always a big plus. A great audience to run your ideas against!

And let’s not forget all the socializing events around the town. Oh, and all the online meetings where like minded people come together. Perhaps try finding a Google Hangout On air that suits your taste? Or start a mastermind group. Another excellent solution for the problem.

## Challenge 5: International Laws & Taxation

Not an challenge to be taken lightly. Whether you're an employer hiring foreign employee(s) on your remote team, or an employee joining an international team, you need to make sure you're complying to international laws & regulations.

*Taxation and compulsory insurances are just two aspects of the story.*  If you're an employer, you may need to register your business with the tax authorities of the country where your remote employee is residing in order to be able to form a legitimate work relationship with her. Many other rules might apply, so make sure you know the legalities and responsibilities before hiring / getting hired for any remote position.

Notice that I don’t mention freelancing / doing business with international clients here. That’s a topic for a whole another article.

**How to work around this challenge:**

Get in touch with the tax authorities in your country and explain them your situation. You need to talk to an professional who is specialized in international taxation. Make sure you get all the details down on paper and understand in practise what your (and your employers) responsibilities are in your particular scenario. Also find out about other legal responsibilities there might exist in addition to taxation. Insurances are often mandatory as well.

These issues can vary quite a bit from country to country so make sure you understand what you're getting into before putting your name on an contract. *You don't want to be the next horror story people share on forums on “how to not do it”.*
