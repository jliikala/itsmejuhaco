Writing is something I've always enjoyed doing, but seldom have in a regular manner. In December 2017, I decided to start building up the habit again by writing something new every week on **[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@juhaliikala/)**.

I haven't set up a blog here on my personal website yet, but I'm considering it if I manage to keep up with my writing properly in 2018 :)

### These are my latest on Medium.com:

* [So Interneters, where do you hang out these days (a brief history in blogging)?](https://medium.com/@juhaliikala/so-interneters-where-do-you-hang-out-these-days-a-brief-history-in-blogging-4a47b162687) - <time datetime="2018-01-02">Jan 2, 2018</time>
* [Whatâ€™s Going To Matter in 2018? Setting Goals, Finding Focus & More.](https://medium.com/@juhaliikala/whats-going-to-matter-in-2018-setting-goals-finding-focus-more-e490d51b7b3b) - <time datetime="2017-12-28">Dec 28, 2017</time>

Thank you for reading!
