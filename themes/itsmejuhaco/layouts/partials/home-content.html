	<h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Juha Liikala</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my humble home on the internets.</p>
	<p>I'm a Finnish Front-End Engineer &amp; Designer, currently at <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</a>. I live and work in the capital of northern Finland, <a href="https://www.ouka.fi/oulu/english/oulu-information">Oulu</a>.</p>
	<p>Iâ€™ve been working in the web industry since 2001. I've freelanced, gone startup founder and worked for several software companies wearing many different hats (front-end, back-end, product design &amp; more). For more detailed professional history, check out my <a href="{{ .Site.Params.linkedinUrl }}">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
	<p>I just launched this site recently, so not much going on here yet. That said, as the year 2018 goes forward, I intend to feature more stuff here, especially when it comes to side projects, writing, and travel.</p>
