      <description>Writing is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed doing, but seldom have in a regular manner. In December 2017, I decided to start building up the habit again by writing something new every week on Medium.com.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t set up a blog here on my personal website yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m considering it if I manage to keep up with my writing properly in 2018 :)
These are my latest on Medium.com:  So Interneters, where do you hang out these days (a brief history in blogging)?</description>

      <description>I usually read 15-30 minutes each day just before bedtime. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be a great way for minimizing screen time in the evening (which I get plenty enough during the daytime already).
